## Red hat openshift cluster Overview
- https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/dev_guide/new_app.html
- https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/welcome/index.html
- With Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, OpenShift developers have a fast and secure way to containerize and deploy enterprise workloads in Kubernetes clusters. OpenShift clusters build on Kubernetes container orchestration that offers consistency and flexibility in operations. Because IBM manages OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), you'll have more time to focus on your core tasks.

## Redhat openshift cluster Features
- OpenShift experience built on Kubernetes
- Use the OpenShift tools and APIs you already know for a single, consistent experience, even when working across hybrid environments or different cloud providers.
- Heightened cluster and app security
- IBM provides security features to protect your cluster infrastructure, isolate your compute resources, encrypt data, and ensure security compliance in your container deployments. Further, OpenShift sets up strict Security Context Constraints for greater pod security by default.
- Worldwide, continuous availability
- Deploy and scale workloads across the globe in all IBM Cloud multizone regions. OpenShift clusters include a managed master that is automatically spread across zones within the region for high availability.
- Integrated OpenShift catalog
- Quickly set up a CI/CD with Jenkins or deploy a variety of apps in a guided experience that's fully integrated into your OpenShift cluster.
- Innovation with Cloud Paks and the complete IBM Cloud platform
- Easily integrate AI with Watson APIs to extend the power of your apps. Access the IBM middleware in IBM Cloud Paks from within the scalable public cloud. You also get built-in services for monitoring, logging, load-balancing, storage, and security to help you manage an appâ€™s lifecycle.
